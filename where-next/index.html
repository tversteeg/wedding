It would be a shame to spend all this time in the airplane just for a single weekend. What follows are some places that we recommend visiting.<p>Vietnam is indeed a long country with diverse types of nature. Before diving into the details, it‚Äôs probably nice to first get to know the country as a whole. Bellows is the picture of different regions in Vietnam.<p><img alt src=/vietnam.png><p>Central Coast and the two islands near Mekong River Delta area have the best beaches ever. If you are in love with the beaches in Croatia, we would say that the beaches here will blow your mind even more. You can find also plenty of astonishing caves (e.g, S∆°n ƒêo√≤ng, Phong Nha, T√∫ L√†n) up north of the Central Coast.<p>As shown in the green color, Northern area and Central Highlands are places where you can find fresh air up high, mountains, and those stunning terraced rice fields.<p>Mekong River Delta area is best known for its floating market on the Mekong river and the plenty mangrove forests.<p>Ho Chi Minh city (S√†i G√≤n) is of course the heart of the Southern area. Unfortunately, the nature here is not so special. But, guess what? We have food! Moreover, affordable luxuries. Let‚Äôs think about an ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù massage at a high-end spa, a fancy cocktail on a rooftop bar with a view which is comparable with the Shard in London, or whatever you never dare to spend the money on that you can name.<p>So, here is the detailed list of places we recommend you visit according to our taste, experiences, and researches. We made it in four main categories [Beaches & Islands, Mountains & Caves, Mekong area, and Main Cities & More] so it is easier for you to go through the list.<h2 id=beaches-islands>Beaches & Islands</h2><h4 id=phu-quoc-nam-du-island>Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc/ Nam Du Island</h4><p><img alt src=/phu-quoc.jpg><p>Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc and Nam Du are close to each other so you can choose either one.<p>Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc is definitely more famous and has more facilities for tourist activities. There are two giant outdoor waterparks and also cable car service. It was the place where the prisoners during Vietnam war were kept. If you are more into the history part, this is the choice.<p>On Nam Du island, you can rent locals‚Äô houses or tents for overnight stays. Nam Du has a great nature (natural rocks, coral reefs, etc.) but there are not as many tourist activities as in Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc. In return, you can enjoy your peaceful time there.<ul><li>Distance: About 400km away from S√†i G√≤n</ul><h6 id=getting-there>Getting There</h6><p>From Saigon, you have to take the bus to Ki√™n Giang at B·∫øn xe mi·ªÅn T√¢y (roughly translated Buses to the West station). After arriving Ki√™n Giang, you take the high speed boat to Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc/ Nam Du island.<p>There are two other routes to get to Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc.<ul><li>By bus: S√†i G√≤n - H√† Ti√™n - Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc. Same as above.<li>By plane: There are direct flights from S√†i G√≤n to Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc Airport.</ul><h4 id=nha-trang-doc-let-diep-son-island>Nha Trang/ D·ªëc L·∫øt/ ƒêi·ªáp S∆°n Island</h4><p><img alt src=/diep-son.jpg><p>Nha Trang is EXTREMELY beautiful and popular beach in Vietnam. It is nowadays fully packed with a lot of Russian and Chinese tourists. If you want to avoid this touristic chaos, we recommend D·ªëc L·∫øt as an perfect alternative. I went there only once on a school trip and can never ever forget its beauty. While writing this post, I believe that this gem still has not been discovered by most of tourists. The evidence is that I could barely find an okay picture anywhere to show you how amazing it is. ƒêi·ªáp S∆°n island is near by and you can have a one-day trip there. Thus, check it out!<ul><li>Distance: 481km away from S√†i G√≤n</ul><h6 id=getting-there-1>Getting There</h6><p>The best way to directly to D·ªëc L·∫øt is getting on a sleeping train to Ninh H√≤a and then get a taxi or scooter taxi to the beach.<h4 id=ha-long-lan-ha-bay>H·∫° Long/ Lan H·∫° Bay</h4><p><img alt src=/ha-long.png><p><a href=https://wikitravel.org/en/Ha_Long_Bay>H·∫° Long Bay</a> is a scenic ocean bay often included in lists of natural wonders of the world. Meanwhile, Lan H·∫° has pretty much the same nature but a lot less touristic. Its location is on the Eastern side of C√°t B√† island and on the Southern side of H·∫° Long bay.<ul><li>Distance: 1800 km away from S√†i G√≤n</ul><h6 id=getting-there-2>Getting There</h6><p>We assume that you will slowly visit the whole country before landing on these islands. So, there are two ways to come to H·∫° Long/ Lan H·∫° from H√† N·ªôi: by bus and by train.<p>In case you feel like skipping other places and want to head directly to H·∫° Long from S√†i G√≤n, you can take a flight.<h2 id=mountains-caves>Mountains & Caves</h2><h4 id=da-lat>ƒê√† L·∫°t</h4><p><img alt src=/da-lat.jpeg><p><a href=https://wikitravel.org/en/Dalat>ƒê√† L·∫°t</a> is a beautiful city in the mountains built by the French colonizers to escape the heat of Saigon. You have to try ‚ÄúB√°nh CƒÉn‚Äù once you get here.<p><img alt src=/banhcan.jpeg><p>Other than that, every street food you can find at the ƒê√† L·∫°t night market is recommeded. And, if you have the mood for some ‚ÄúAlney s be your telf‚Äù t-shirt like Thomas did, this is the place to find it.<p><img alt src=/alneys.jpg><ul><li>Distance: 250 km away from S√†i G√≤n</ul><h6 id=getting-there-3>Getting There</h6><p>We recommend taking the sleeping bus, which takes around 6 hours to get there. If you don‚Äôt opt for the cheapest ones the bus can be quite comfortable. It‚Äôs recommended to ask how big the beds are, especially for tall people.<h4 id=sa-pa-y-ty>Sa Pa/ Y T√Ω</h4><p><img alt src=/sapa.jpg><p>Terraced rice fields are the symbol of the Northern area in Vietnam. You can find them at many places. The most famous spot for tourists is definitely Sa Pa. You can do your own reaserch about this town <a href=https://wikitravel.org/en/Sapa>here</a> for more information. Mind you, the weather in the North of Vietnam is pretty cold during January. The rice fields are mostly dead at this time. The nature is of course still stunning but it might not be the same as what you have in your mind about terraced rice fields.<p><img alt src=/yty.jpg><p>Close to Sa Pa is Y T√Ω, another hidden gem from Vietnam. Y T√Ω is the home of four ethnic groups of Vietnam (M√¥ng, H√† Nh√¨, Dao, and Kinh). 77,5% of the residents living here are listed as ‚Äúpoor‚Äù. It means that you might lack a lot of modern-life conveniences during your stay, such as electricity, mobilephone network, or internet, etc. But, in return, you can for sure enjoy your ‚Äúsilent‚Äù time here.<ul><li>Distance: 2000km away from S√†i G√≤n</ul><h6 id=getting-there-4>Getting There</h6><p>You can take train or bus from H√† N·ªôi to L√†o Cai. From L√†o Cai you can take another bus to Sa Pa. There are also direct buses from H√† N·ªôi to Sa Pa which would take about 6 or 7 hours.<p>From Sa Pa, you can rent a scooter or go with the bus to Y T√Ω.<h2 id=mekong-delta-area>Mekong Delta Area</h2><h3 id=ca-mau>C√† Mau</h3><p><img alt src=/camau.jpg><p>You should definitely not skip the floating market on the Mekong river if you come visiting C√† Mau. There are other famous floating markets (C√°i B√®/ C√°i RƒÉng) in C·∫ßn Th∆°. However, we do think that it would save you a lot of traveling time if you go to the floating market and the mangrove forest in the same city.<h2 id=main-cities-more>Main Cities & More</h2><h3 id=sai-gon-ha-noi>S√†i G√≤n/ H√† N·ªôi</h3><p>Big cities are just big cities. You won‚Äôt find any interesting nature here but in return, as we mentioned above, you can find several affordable luxuries in S√†i G√≤n and/or H√† N·ªô since they are the two largest cities in Vietnam. Besides, food is what you have to try when visit these cities. Here is the list what H√† thinks that you should definitely try at least once:<ul><li>C∆°m t·∫•m<li>B√°nh tr√°ng tr·ªôn/ b√°nh tr√°ng cu·ªën<li>B√°nh x√®o<li>B√∫n mƒÉng v·ªãt<li>B·ªôt chi√™n<li>B√°nh cu·ªën SG<li>B√°nh canh<li>H·ªß t√≠u kh√¥<li>Ph·ªü cu·ªën<li>X√¥i<li>B√∫n ngan<li>B√∫n ·ªëc<li>Ch√°o trai/ ch√°o s∆∞·ªùn<li>B√°nh cu·ªën HN</ul><h3 id=hue-da-nang-hoi-an>Hu·∫ø/ ƒê√† N·∫µng/ H·ªôi An</h3><p><img alt src=/cauvang.jpg><p>According to Wikipedia, B√† N√† Hills, located in ƒê√† N·∫µng, is advertised as ‚Äúthe ƒê√† L·∫°t of ƒê√† N·∫µng province‚Äù. Of course, it was founded by the French colonists to be a leisure destination for (French) tourists. If it is the ƒê√† L·∫°t, what is the reasons to visit, you wondered. Yes yes, here you have beaches and BRIDGES. We don‚Äôt really understand why people go crazy for bridges so much. But, since the bridges here got recommended in several travel articles, we have to introduce them to you.<ul><li>Distance: 960km away from S√†i G√≤n</ul><p><img alt src=/hoian.jpg><p>And, because you are already in ƒê√† N·∫µng, it‚Äôs a pity if you don‚Äôt visit H·ªôi An. As it stated <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%E1%BB%99i_An>here</a>, H·ªôi An is an exceptionally well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port from 15th to 19th century. Every lunar month (yup, not western calendar), on the 14th, the lantern festival will take place in this town.<p>-Distance: 937km away from S√†i G√≤n<p><img alt src=/hue.jpg><p>Hu·∫ø used to be the capital of the country. During the French Indochina, it was the administrative capital of the protectorate of Annam. If you are into good food and history, this is the place where you should visit.<ul><li>Distance: 1043km away from S√†i G√≤n</ul><h6 id=getting-there-5>Getting There</h6><p>We recommend you to take the train to ƒê√† N·∫µng, stay there overnight, rent a scooter or take a cab to H·ªôi An, chill a bit, and go back to ƒê√† N·∫µng at the end of the day, and then take the train to Hu·∫ø. If you have tight schedule, take the flight directly to ƒê√† N·∫µng. There is also an international airport in ƒê√† N·∫µng. You can also fly to/from ƒê√† N·∫µng to/from Amsterdam.<h3 id=phnom-penh-cambodia>Phnom Penh, Cambodia</h3><p><img alt src=/phnom-penh.png><p><a href=https://wikitravel.org/en/Phnom_Penh>Phnom Penh</a> is the capital and largest city of Cambodia. Phnom Penh is really close to Saigon. It‚Äôs a good option if you want to make a tour around the Southern area Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries.<ul><li>Distance: 250 km away from Saigon.</ul><p>We believe that this list gives enough information and inspiration for you to plan the trip to Vietnam. If you have any questions, ask Google! ^_^</div></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=article-footer><div class="columns is-multiline"><div class="column is-12"><p>Published <time datetime=2021-02-10> 2021-02-10 </time> and tagged <a href=https://ha-thomas-y.eu/tags/travel/> <span class="tag is-link">travel </span> </a> and <a href=https://ha-thomas-y.eu/tags/tips/> <span class="tag is-link">tips </span> </a></div><div class=column><a class="button is-pulled-right is-info" href=/>Back Home</a></div></div></div></footer></div></article></div></div></section></main><script src=https://ha-thomas-y.eu/js/zulma_navbar.js></script>
