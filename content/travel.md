We would like to organize an extra small holiday for the people who are interested in it. It will be travelling to two amazing locations in Vietnam with a big group. If you would like to travel independently we understand that but please don't come to Vietnam just for our wedding, that won't be worth the long distance trip.

## ƒê√† L·∫°t (10-13 January)

Our first destination after Saigon will be the beautiful mountain city ƒê√† L·∫°t, check [Where To Next](../where-next) for some general information about it.

#### Getting There

There's two recommended ways to go to ƒê√† L·∫°t from Saigon, by bus and by plane (if a long busride is too much for you).

##### Bus

The upgraded sleeper bus from Saigon to ƒê√† L·∫°t takes about 7 hours and costs around {{ vnd(vnd=350000) }}. The bus can be taken at night so it also saves the cost of a hotel for one day.

##### Plane

Going by plane costs around {{ vnd(vnd=950000) }} and the flying time is about 1h.

#### Hotel

The hotel will probably cost around {{ vnd(vnd=750000) }} per night.

#### What we'll visit

- Recycled pagoda made from trash
- Waterfalls
- Coffee & tea farm tour
- Evening market

## ƒê√† N·∫µng (13-19 January)

Our second destination Saigon will be the centrally located hub ƒê√† N·∫µng, check [Where To Next](../where-next) for some general information about it.

#### Getting There

There's two recommended ways to go to ƒê√† N·∫µng from ƒê√† L·∫°t, by bus+train and by plane.

##### Bus + Train

The bus from ƒê√† L·∫°t to Nha Trang takes about 3-4 hours and costs around {{ vnd(vnd=150000) }}. After that the train takes around 10 hours and costs about {{ vnd(vnd=450000) }}. The best option for the train is the one that leaves around 12 at night and arrives at 10 AM. This way you can have sleep the required 8 hours and it will also save the costs of a hotel for one evening.

Going by plane costs around {{ vnd(vnd=1750000) }} and the flying time is about 1h 10 min.

#### Hotel

The hotel will probably cost around {{ vnd(vnd=700000) }} per night.
