We would like to organize an extra small holiday for the people who are interested in it. It will be travelling to two amazing locations in Vietnam with a big group. If you would like to travel independently we understand that but please don't come to Vietnam just for our wedding, that won't be worth the long distance trip.

## Đà Lạt (10-13 January)

Our first destination after Saigon will be the beautiful mountain city Đà Lạt, check [Where To Next](../where-next) for some general information about it.

#### Getting There

We recommend going to Đà Lạt from Saigon by bus during the day.

##### Bus

The upgraded sleeper bus from Saigon to Đà Lạt takes about 7 hours and costs around {{ vnd(vnd=350000) }}. This is a quite comfortable bus where you lie down.

#### Hotel

The hotel will probably cost around {{ vnd(vnd=750000) }} per night.

#### What we'll visit

- Recycled pagoda made from trash
- Waterfalls
- Coffee & tea farm tour
- Evening market

## Đà Nẵng (13-19 January)

Our second destination Saigon will be the centrally located hub Đà Nẵng, check [Where To Next](../where-next) for some general information about it.

#### Getting There

We recommend going to Đà Nẵng from Đà Lạt by bus during the day.

##### Bus + Train

The bus from Đà Lạt to Nha Trang takes about 3-4 hours and costs around {{ vnd(vnd=150000) }}. After that the train takes around 10 hours and costs about {{ vnd(vnd=450000) }}. The best option for the train is the one that leaves around 12 at night and arrives at 10 AM. This way you can have sleep the required 8 hours and it will also save the costs of a hotel for one evening.

###### Nha Trang

After arriving in Nha Trang you can relax a bit and have a quick swim in the ocean, which will be warmer than the one in Đà Nẵng.

#### Hotel

The hotel will probably cost around {{ vnd(vnd=700000) }} per night.

#### Things we'll visit

- Hội An
- The beach
- Buddhist caves
