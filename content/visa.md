## E-Visa

In order to enter Vietnam, you need to be Vietnamese(duh?) or you'll need a visa. Most of the EU passport holders can apply for an e-visa, which will let you board the airplane. The e-visa is valid for only 30 days and single entry. If you want to stay longer in Vietnam, you can apply for another tourist visa, which unfortunately the government doesn't issue for now because of the corona situation.

Applying for an e-visa can be done [here](https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/trang-chu-ttdt).

Keep in mind that an e-visa is more like an invitation letter to let you board the plane. When you arrive at the Vietnamese airport, you will need to fill in a form and pay fees to get the visa stickers for your passport. They only accept US dollars or Vietnamese Dong for these fees and there's no ATM, so make sure you have some on you.

#### Important info

Triple check the data on the e-visa application! If you enter any wrong information, and the Vietnamese embassy won't check it for you, you will not be able to board the plane.
Yes, yes. What an obvious statement we are making, don't you think? Who the hell on Earth would fill out a visa application form with his ID number swapped with his BSN number, right??? You'll be surprised with how stupid one can be, *cough* Thomas *cough*..

## Emergency Visa

It's possible, and expensive, to get a last "minute" visa.

They will need at least 45 minutes to issue an e-visa and keep in mind the different time zone. So, our suggestion is that coming to the airport as early as possible, so you can have enough time to fix your mistakes if you made one.

Don't let your father-in-law wash your pants with the passport still in the pocket. *cough* like Thomas *cough*
If you have a good quality passport, then okay, do as you want. But if your passport is not as good as the Dutch one, then don't. If the visa sticker is not readable, you might not be able to get out of the country.
January is the time for our Tet holidays, which means that NO EMBASSY is going to work and NO GOVERNMENT AGENCY is going to issue a new visa for you. 
It means that you will get stuck in Vietnam for a minimum of 3 weeks.
