We will arrange a hotel deal for the guests for the wedding. This is not mandatory so if you want to find your own place that's also okay.

If you want this please supply us with the follownig information:
- What is your budget per day?
- How many days do you want to stay in Ho Chi Minh city?
- What is the minimum level of luxury you're okay with?
- With how many people will you share a room?

We do recommend staying in this hotel though, or somewhere close, since it will be easier for us to organize things with the whole group.
At least for the wedding days.

We are still looking for the hotel, we will update this page when we find one meeting all our requirements.

If you want to find your own hotel we recommend finding one near the location on the map:
