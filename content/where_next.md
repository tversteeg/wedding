Of course you want to see other things after (or before) the wedding.
It would be a shame to spent all this time in the airplane just for a single weekend.
What follows are some places that we recommend visiting:

### Đà Lạt, Việt Nam

[Đà Lạt](https://wikitravel.org/en/Dalat) is a beautiful city in the mountains built by the French colonizers to escape the heat of Saigon.

- Distance: 250 km

#### Getting There

We recommend taking the sleeper bus, which takes around 6 hours to get there. If you don't opt for the cheapest ones the bus can be quite comfortable. It's recommended to ask how big the beds are, especially for tall people.

### Phnom Penh, Cambodia
