We will not have any dress code because we don't want to force you to buy an extra item just for our wedding that you won't need afterwards.

However, we understand that there are cultural differences in a way of how two parties dress for special occasions.

Therefore, we will (in a later update) give you some suggestions for how Vietnamese people would dress to a wedding.
