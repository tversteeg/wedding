#### Traditional Vietnamese Ceremony

![](/mamqu.png)

In the early morning we will hold a [traditional Vietnamese tea ceremony](https://vietnamtravel.com/traditional-vietnamese-tea-ceremony/) at Ha's parents house. It usually takes place at 9 AM and ends before lunch time.

#### Lunch

After the ceremony there will be some time to relax and eat something small.
We will look for a place with AC to chill so everyone doesn't have to suffer Saigon's deadly heat.

#### Reception

We will hold a reception in the afternoon. The whole ceremony will occur from probably 5 PM to 9 PM. The first hour is for welcome drinks and finger food. In a traditional Vietnamese wedding that Ha vividly remembers, people usually start having the first course at 6:30 PM and finish the last course at 9 PM. There are normally at least five courses, including two appetizers, one main course, a hotpot, and dessert. How many courses will there be at our wedding? It still needs to be discussed.

#### After Party

Yes yes, it's the time for everyone to get drunk (except the bride). Which type of bar are you into? A chill bar with slow music to talk? A rooftop bar with EDM music? Send us your preference along with your RSVP.
