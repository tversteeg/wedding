We are not going to have a gift wishlist for our wedding like in the Western tradition since we will follow the Vietnamese tradition.

In Vietnam, people will gift the newlywed money as a way to help them pay out their wedding costs.
People will put the money in the invitation envelope and give them at the reception table at the beginning of the evening ceremony.
The amount of money depends on your financial status, how many people will go with you (partners, children, etc.), the current price of a restaurant meal for one person times the number of people are joining, and lastly the amount of money the (parents of) the newlywed used to gift you in your (children) wedding in the past.

For our wedding, you can just consider what feels right for yourself.
We think that it's easy for the people (not have to think of the gifts) as well as for us (not have to buy extra luggage to carry all the gifts back to the NL) if we keep the Vietnamese tradition.
