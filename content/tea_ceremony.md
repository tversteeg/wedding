### Send Us

Please follow all measurements from [this video on how to measure for Ao Dai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50letBoJu6k). There are English subtitles which should make it quite clear what to measure.

Write the measurements down and send them to us by e-mail or WhatsApp.

Also send us a photo of you standing straight, from top to toe. And the sizes you use to buy your clothes.
