We recommend booking the plane 6 months in advance to get a good deal.

You can fly from Amsterdam to Ho Chi Minh city with a transit flight, or drive to Frankfurt and take a direct flight.

The airline we recommend are "Vietnam Airlines", since they have big planes with a bit more leg space.
The airlines you should avoid are "Swiss Airlines" and "Edelweiss" because the planes are small and there's little room for your body parts. If you have Ha's size (unlikely) it doesn't matter which line you book.
