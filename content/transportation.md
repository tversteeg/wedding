### Visa

There's two ways to get a visa for Vietnam, e-visa on arrival and a regular visa.

#### E-Visa

You can apply for an e-visa on [this Vietnamese government site](https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/en_US/web/guest/khai-thi-thuc-dien-tu/cap-thi-thuc-dien-tu). You will have to pay 25 dollars in advance. You will also have to pay dollars when you arrive in Vietnam, which isn't mentioned on the website. It's not possible to use an ATM behind the border where you need to pay the dollars, so bring at least $50 if you want to go for this visa.

Don't forget to double check all information on the application, otherwise you're visa will be refused at the check-in, meaning you'll have a couple of minutes to hastily book a very expensive last-minute visa. This will create a lot of stress, not recommended.

### Plane

We recommend booking the plane 6 months in advance to get a good deal.

You can fly from Amsterdam to Ho Chi Minh city with a transit flight, or drive to Frankfurt and take a direct flight.

The airline we recommend are "Vietnam Airlines", since they have big planes with a bit more leg space.
The airlines you should avoid are "Swiss Airlines" and "Edelweiss" because the planes are small and there's little room for your body parts. If you have Ha's size (unlikely) it doesn't matter which line you book.
